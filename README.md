## About Me

I am a full-stack web-developer based in India.

I started coding back in 2020 during the lockdown. From knowing nothing to building something I have come a long way. But this is just the start.

I love making dynamic and 3d sites. I write all my styles in CSS and that is my favorite language. I mostly use React to do all my works.
