## About Me

I am a full-stack web-developer based in India.

I started coding back in 2020 during the lockdown. From knowing nothing to building something I have come a long way. But this is just the start.

I love making dynamic and 3d sites. I write all my styles in CSS and that is my favorite language. I mostly use React to do all my works. 

## Education

- B.Tech from Techno Main Salt Lake
- B.Sc from IIT Madras

## Projects

### [Project 1: Anime Quotes Generator](animelife.live)

- This is a brand that I made for helping content creators to get innovative quotes with just a single click.
- Since, I love anime so, this shows my contribution towards the community.
- The frontend is made with React and the backend is made with FastApi. 
- The quotes are generated from a public rest api.
